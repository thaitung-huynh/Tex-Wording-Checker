This paper is about cyber_security in modern society.
Some people also write cybersecurity or even cyb,
but they all mean the same thing.

We define that \textbf{cybersecurity} is a key concept in technology.
However, mistakes like \emph{cyb} or cyber_security are common.

\begin{verbatim}
Inside verbatim environment, words like cyber_security or cyb
should not be changed.
\end{verbatim}

Mathematical expression should stay the same: $a + b = c$ and
$\cyb + \cybersecurity = \text{secure}$.

\lstinline|cyber_security| should also remain unchanged.
